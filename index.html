    <!--About Me-->
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Taylor and I am an aspiring software developer. The intention of this page is to showcase some of my work and provide you with some information about myself.</p>

    <!--My Background-->
    <h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>For 7 years I have been a call-taker at a 24 hour IT hotline, working for a well known healthcare company. The work mainy revolved around security and access managment, as well as direct software and hardware troubleshooting and support. The environment was fast paced, and more often than not there was a high volume of calls, but all in all I found working directly with the clients to be both fun and rewarding.</p>
    <p>Before I worked in IT I was an aspiring musician. After high school I enrolled in community college to pursue my degree in music performance. While I never did become a professional musician, songwriting is still a passion of mine and I still continue to write in my free time.</p>
