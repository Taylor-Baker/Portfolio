    <!--About Me-->
    <div>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Taylor and <strong>I am an aspiring software developer</strong>. The intention of this page is to showcase some of my work and provide you with some information about myself.</p>

      <!--My Background-->
      <h3>My Background</h3>
      <p>For 7 years I have been a call-taker at a 24 hour IT hotline, working for a well known healthcare company. The work mainy revolves around security and access managment, as well as direct software and hardware troubleshooting and support. The environment is fast paced, and more often than not there is a high volume of calls, but all in all <strong>I find working directly with the clients to be both fun and rewarding</strong>.</p>

      <!--Education-->
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <h4>> Previous</h4>
      <p>Before I worked in IT I was an aspiring musician. After high school I enrolled in community college to pursue my degree in music performance. While I never did become a professional musician, songwriting is still a passion of mine and <strong>I still continue to write music in my free time</strong>.</p>

      <h4>> Current</h4>
      <p>As I type this, I am currently a full-time student at Epicodus, a school for those who wish to learn computer programming. I have chosen to pursue a career code for a multitude of reasons, the bulk of which would likely bore you, but of those reasons I believe a few are worth illistrating:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>money (maybe tell the story of hearing one line of a book (think and grow rich) and have it challenge you in such an immediate way.)</li>
        <li>skill ()</li>
        <li>purpose (talk about; ideals, hopes for a use for the code)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <p>My interests and hobbies fall into three general catagories: <strong>music</strong>, <strong>gaming</strong>, and <strong>self-improvement</strong>.</p>

      <!--Music-->
      <h4>> Music</h4>
      <p>My true first passion is music, in nearly all of it's forms. I realized my love of music early on in high school and have been singing and songwriting every since. <strong>I even went as far as go to collage to pursue a vocal performance degree</strong>.</p>
      <p>Though I have never pursued music in a professional capacity, <strong>I still play and write music privately</strong> on a weekly basis.</p>

      <!--Gaming-->
      <h4>> Gaming</h4>
      <p>To me, there has never been a more enjoyable way to pass time than to sit in a room with friends and play a boardgame or video game. Whether it's a Halo LAN party or a one-on-one game of the Dominion card game, casual or competitive, <strong>gaming has always and will always be my favorite way to socialize and have fun</strong>.</p>

      <!--Self-Improvement-->
