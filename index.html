      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>My name is Taylor and <strong>I am an aspiring software developer</strong>. The intention of this page is to showcase some of my work and to let you get to know me a little better.</p>
      <p>The site is divided into three main sections, each with their own subsections:</p>

    <!--About Me-->
    <div>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <!--Background-->
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p class="about-me-text">For the past seven years I have been a call-taker at a 24/7 IT hotline, working for a well known healthcare company. The work mainy revolves around security and access managment, as well as direct software and hardware troubleshooting and support. The environment is fast paced, and more often than not there is a high volume of calls, but all in all <strong>I find working directly with the clients to be both fun and rewarding</strong>.</p>

      <!--Education-->
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <img src="img/e-learning-art.png" class="education-image">
      <h4 class="education-text">> Previous</h4>
      <p>Before I worked in IT I was an aspiring musician. After high school I enrolled in community college to pursue my degree in music performance. While I never did become a professional musician, songwriting is still a passion of mine and <strong>I still continue to write music in my free time</strong>.</p>

      <h4 class="education-text">> Current</h4>
      <p>Even as I type this, <strong>I am currently a full-time student at Epicodus</strong>, a school for those who wish to learn computer programming. I have chosen to pursue a career code for a multitude of reasons, the bulk of which would likely bore you, but of those reasons I believe a few are worth illistrating:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <ol class="education-text">
            <li><strong>Money</strong> - to better provide for myself and my family. Additionally, to save up for higher education.</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity</strong> - coding is today's language of creation. With code we can make nearly anything happen in this lifetime. There is something truly beautiful and wonderful about that.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose</strong> - a use for the knowledge and skills beyond simply changing careers. I decided to learn code because I wanted the skill of coding, not just because I wanted to become a coder per se.</li>
          </ol>

      <!--Professional Skills-->
      <h3>Professional Skills</h3>
      <p>Between my recent career in IT and the career in coding that I am working towards even now, <strong>I have been able to gather an array of skills</strong>, both technical and interpersonal.</p>

    <!--Interests and Hobbies-->
    <div class="interest-text">
      <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <p>My interests and hobbies fall into three general catagories: <strong>music</strong>, <strong>gaming</strong>, and <strong>self-improvement</strong>.</p>

      <!--Music-->
      <div class="row interest-row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <h4>> Music</h4>
          <p>My true first passion is music, in nearly all of it's forms. I realized my love of music in early high school and have been singing and songwriting ever since. I even went as far as go to collage to pursue a vocal performance degree, and although I have yet to pursue music in any professional capacity, <strong>I still play and write music</strong> privately, on a regular basis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <img src="img/music-icons.png" class="interest-img">
        </div>
      </div>

      <!--Gaming-->
      <div class="row interest-row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <img src="img/games-icons.png" class="interest-img interest-center">
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <h4>> Gaming</h4>
          <p>To me, there has never been a more enjoyable way to pass time than to sit in a room with friends and play a boardgame or video game. Whether it's a Halo LAN party or a one-on-one game of the Dominion card game, casual or competitive, <strong>gaming has always and will always be my favorite way to socialize and have fun</strong>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!--Self-Improvement-->
      <div class="row interest-row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <h4>> Self-Improvement</h4>
          <p>Self-improvement, self-realization, self-actualization; no matter what you call it, <strong>I want to be the very best version of myself that I possibly can be</strong>. And not simply on a moral or ethical level, but on every level: mental, physical, emotional, and even socially. To be able to have the greatest and most positive impact on this world, in this lifetime, it is imperitive to always be striving towards the person you aim to be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <img src="img/self-improvement-icons.png" class="interest-img interest-adj">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--Goals-->
    <div>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>Coding is more than a mere stepping stone on my path of life, but it is also not the entirety of my path from here forward. I have goals and a purpose for the education I'm receiving, both professional and personal.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <!--Career-->
        <div class="col-6">
          <h3>Career</h3>
          <p>The vision I have in mind for my career (at this point in time at least) is to bring together a small group of likeminded coders to create apps that help people help themselves. I want the technology I create to help others break free from the programming of the world and allow them to become the people they actually want to be.</p>
        </div>
        <!--Personal-->
        <div class="col-6">
          <h3>Personal</h3>
          <p>On a more personal note, there are some things I would like to do with my coding knowledge that have nothing to do with my career. I would very much like to make a certain video game a reality. I've had an idea brewing in my mind for a number of years and with the expertise to make that into a reality I could see a nearly lifelong dream achieved.</p>
